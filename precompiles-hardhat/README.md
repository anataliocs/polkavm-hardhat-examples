# Sample Polkadot Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates how to use Hardhat with Polkadot. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

1) Compile the contract:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

2) Try running defined tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```
