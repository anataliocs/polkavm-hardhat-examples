# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please help us by responsibly disclosing it.

### üö® **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities

Instead, please:

1. **Create a private security advisory** on GitHub:
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/anataliocs/polkavm-hardhat-examples/security) of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability" to create a private security advisory
   - Provide detailed information about the vulnerability

2. **Contact the maintainers directly**:
   - Email: [Contact via GitHub profile](https://github.com/anataliocs)
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line
   - Provide as much detail as possible to reproduce and assess the impact

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide the following information:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Components**: Which contracts, scripts, or components are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue
- **Environment**: Version information, network details, etc.

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Assessment**: We'll assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical issues will be addressed immediately; other issues within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate with you on responsible disclosure timing

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest main branch | ‚úÖ |
| Tagged releases | ‚úÖ |
| Development branches | ‚ùå |

## Security Scope

This security policy covers:

### ‚úÖ In Scope
- Smart contracts in the `/uniswap/contracts/` directory
- Deployment scripts and configuration
- Test files that could reveal vulnerabilities
- Documentation that could lead to insecure implementations
- CI/CD pipeline security

### ‚ùå Out of Scope
- Issues in external dependencies (please report to respective maintainers)
- General Hardhat framework issues
- Polkadot/Substrate core protocol issues
- Third-party tools and services

## Smart Contract Security Considerations

This repository contains **financial smart contracts** dealing with token swaps and liquidity. Common vulnerability categories to be aware of:

### Critical Vulnerabilities
- **Reentrancy attacks** (direct and cross-function)
- **Access control bypasses**
- **Integer overflow/underflow**
- **Flash loan attacks**
- **Oracle manipulation**
- **Price manipulation**
- **Unauthorized token draining**

### High-Priority Areas
- Token transfer logic
- Liquidity pool calculations
- Access control mechanisms
- Emergency pause functionality
- Upgrade mechanisms (if applicable)

## Security Tools and Analysis

This repository uses several security tools:

### Automated Security Scanning
- **CodeQL**: Automated vulnerability detection (runs on every PR)
- **Solhint**: Solidity linting with security rules
- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript security patterns

### Recommended Additional Tools
- **Slither**: Static analysis for Solidity contracts
- **Mythril**: Symbolic execution security analyzer
- **Echidna**: Fuzzing framework for smart contracts
- **Foundry**: Testing and fuzzing capabilities

### Security Testing
We encourage security-focused testing including:
- Reentrancy attack simulations
- Access control testing
- Edge case and boundary testing
- Invariant testing
- Gas optimization attacks

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this repository:

1. **Follow the security guidelines** in [`copilot-instructions.md`](./copilot-instructions.md)
2. **Review the vulnerability checklist** before submitting code
3. **Write security-focused tests** for any new functionality
4. **Use established patterns** from OpenZeppelin and other audited contracts
5. **Avoid experimental or unproven patterns** in production code
